    // DOM methods for changing content:
        // 1. innerHTML
            // - changes/sets content of an element (including HTML tags)
            // - takes into account the CSS styling and may provide a "cleaned up" version of the text that is visible to the user.
            // - this is better for when we want to change the content and the HTML nested inside the element
            // - this is slower and can be a security risk if we are not careful

        // 2. textContent
            // - changes/sets content of an element (excluding HTML tags)
            // - best practice, doesn't consider styling and doesn't trigger reflows or repaints FASTER!
            // - this is better for when we want to change the content

        // 3. innerText
            // - changes/sets content of an element (including HTML tags)
            // - takes into account the CSS styling and may provide a "cleaned up" version of the text that is visible to the user.
            // - This is better for when we want more readable content, 
            // - removes hidden elements and styles

        // 1. innerHTML
        var main = document.getElementById('main');
        // main.innerHTML = "Changed Content";
        const name = 'Abdisa'

        main.innerHTML = `
            <h1>Hello ${name}!</h1>
        `

        // 2. textContent (best practice, doesn't consider styling and doesn't trigger reflows or repaints FASTER!)
        console.log(main.textContent.length);
        console.log("------ TEXT CONTENT ------")
        for (var i = 0; i < main.textContent.length; i++) {
            console.log(main.textContent[i]);
        }

        // 3. innerText
        console.log(main.innerText.length);
        console.log("------ INNER TEXT ------")
        for (var i = 0; i < main.innerText.length; i++) {
            console.log(main.innerText[i]);
        }

        const p = document.querySelector('p');
        p.innerText = "This is a new paragraph";

        Handling of Styles and Layout:

        innerText: 
            It returns the visible text content of an element, excluding any hidden or styled elements. 
            It takes into account the CSS styling and may provide a "cleaned up" version of the 
            text that is visible to the user.
        textContent: It returns all text content within an element, including both visible and hidden text. 
        It doesn't consider the styling and provides a raw representation of the text as it is in the DOM.

        Performance:
        innerText: 
            Since it considers styling and layout, it might trigger reflows and repaints, 
            potentially making it slower in terms of performance, 
            especially if used in a loop or on large documents.

        textContent: 
            It usually performs better because it doesn't consider styling and doesn't trigger reflows or repaints.
