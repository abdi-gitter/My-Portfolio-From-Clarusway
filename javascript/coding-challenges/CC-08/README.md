# JS-CC-08 : Email Validator

The purpose of this coding challenge is to create a function that will check the given email address valid or not.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

 - Write a function that takes email variable and return `true` or `false` and write console `invalid` or `valid`.

- Valid characters in the email address will be 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_+.@' P.S. : Capital letters are allowed.
