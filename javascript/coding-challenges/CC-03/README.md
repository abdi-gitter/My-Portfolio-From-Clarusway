# JS-CC-03 : Check Palindrome

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a code that checks whether a string is palindromic or not.

**What is palindrome?**

> A **palindrome** is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as the words *madam* or *racecar*, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal – Panama".


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

- Take an input from user. 

- Check that input whether it is palindromic or not:
  - if palindromic then console log that it is palindromic

  - if not palindromic then console log that it is not palindromic
