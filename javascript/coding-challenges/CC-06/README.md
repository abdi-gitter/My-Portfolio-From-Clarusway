# JS-CC-06 : Merge Arrays

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a code that given two sorted arrays, returns merged array of these inputs.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

- Write a function that takes two arrays consist of numbers and combines them into one sorted array as result.

- Please note that, empty arrays to be checked to avoid exception!

- Please take a look at the empty function:

```js
function mergeArrays(ArrayA, ArrayB) {
  // Write your code to combine the sorted arrays into sorted Result Array
}
```

samples

```js
mergeArrays([], [7, 8, 9]);
expected_result = [7, 8, 9];


mergeArrays([12, 14, 16], [11, 13, 17]);
expected_result = [11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17];


mergeArrays([22, 24, 26, 28], [21, 27]);
expected_result = [21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28];
```
