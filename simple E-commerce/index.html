<!-- 
    The `<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3 g-4"></div>` 
    is a class attribute using Bootstrap's grid system, a popular 
    front-end framework.

Here's what each class does:

- `row`: This is a Bootstrap class used for a grid container, 
which holds and aligns the grid columns. It's a flex container 
that wraps the columns.

- `row-cols-1`: This class sets the number of columns in the
 row to be 1 for all breakpoints except those overridden by a 
 more specific class. It means that by default, you'll have one 
 column stretching the full width of the row.

- `row-cols-md-3`: This class changes the behavior at 
the medium breakpoint (defined in Bootstrap, typically 
around 768px screen width) and above. At this point, 
it will display 3 columns per row. So, if your viewport 
is at least as wide as the medium breakpoint, it will switch 
from 1 column to 3 columns.

- `g-4`: This class adds gutters (spacing) around the columns. 
The size of the gutters is determined by the number following 
the `g`. Bootstrap has a predefined scale of gutter widths, 
and `g-4` is a value on this scale. It will add space around 
each column within the row.

In summary, when you use this `<div>`, you are setting 
    up a responsive grid container that will have one full-width 
    column on small screens and three equal-width columns on 
    medium screens and larger. There will also be spacing around 
    the columns thanks to the gutter class. If there's no 
    content inside the div, it won't be visible, but it's 
    structured to hold grid columns as per the classes defined.
